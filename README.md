# Reinforcement Learning Homework

In this homework, we address the task of learning control policies for text-based games using reinforcement learning. In these games, all interactions between players and the virtual world are through text. The current world state is described by elaborate text, and the underlying state is not directly observable. Players read descriptions of the state and respond with natural language commands to take actions.

For this project you will conduct experiments on a small **Home World**, which mimic the environment of a typical house.The world consists of a few rooms, and each room contains a representative object that the player can interact with. For instance, the kitchen has an apple that the player can eat. The goal of the player is to finish some quest. An example of a quest given to the player in text is **"You are hungry now"**. To complete this quest, the player has to navigate through the house to reach the kitchen and eat the apple. In this game, the room is hidden from the player, who only receives a description of the underlying room. At each step, the player read the text describing the current room and the quest, and respond with some command (e.g., **eat apple**). The player then receives some reward that depends on the state and his/her command. In order to design an autonomous game player, we will employ a reinforcement learning framework to learn command policies using game rewards as feedback.

Consider a text-based game represented by the tuple $$H,C,P,R,\gamma ,\Psi$$. Here $H$ is the set of all possible game states. The actions taken by the player are multi-word natural language **commands** such as **eat apple** or **go east**. In this homework we limit ourselves to consider commands consisting of one action (e.g., **eat**) and one argument object (e.g. **apple**).
$C=\{ (a,b)\}$ is the set of all commands (action-object pairs).
$P:H\times C\times H\rightarrow [0,1]$ is the transition matrix: $P(h'|h,a,b)$ is the probability of reaching state $h'$ if command $c = (a,b)$ is taken in state $h$.
$R:H\times C\rightarrow \mathbb {R}$ is the deterministic reward function: $R(h,a,b)$ is the immediate reward the player obtains when taking command $(a,b)$ in state $h$. We consider discounted accumulated rewards where $\gamma$ is the discount factor. In particular, the game state $h$ is hidden from the player, who only receives a varying textual description. Let $S$ denote the space of all possible text descriptions. The text descriptions $s$ observed by the player are produced by a stochastic function $\Psi :H\rightarrow S$. Assume that each observable state $s\in S$ is associated with a **unique** hidden state, denoted by $h(s)\in H$.

You will conduct experiments on a small Home World, which mimic the environment of a typical house. The world consists of four rooms- a living room, a bed room, a kitchen and a garden with connecting pathways (illustrated in figure below). Transitions between the rooms are deterministic. Each room contains a representative object that the player can interact with. For instance, the living room has a TV that the player can watch , and the kitchen has an apple that the player can eat. Each room has several descriptions, invoked randomly on each visit by the player.
